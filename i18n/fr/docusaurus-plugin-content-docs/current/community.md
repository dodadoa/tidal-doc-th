## Getting Help

The main place to get help is the [Tidal Club](https://club.tidalcycles.org/) forum, for example the [Installation help](https://club.tidalcycles.org/c/installation/5) and [Questions and Answers](https://club.tidalcycles.org/c/q-and-a/9) sections. You can [search the forum](https://club.tidalcycles.org/search) to see if someone had the same problem or question as you before, or post a new topic (requires [free signup](https://club.tidalcycles.org/signup)).
## Discussion and sharing

For live chat, you can find other TidalCyclists on the [TidalCycles discord server](https://discord.gg/CqWhZEfNbq), and in the `#tidal` channel on the [TOPLAP rocketchat server](https://chat.toplap.org/channel/tidal).
