## Tidal 1.0.0

Under the hood, **Tidal** `1.0.0` is a major rewrite. If you're used to previous versions, this will mostly be evident in terms of new functionality. But there are some breaking changes too. Below is a growing list of changes and additions. I, Yaxu, have tried to thank people who have done/contributed towards things, apologies to those I've missed. Things not marked are probably entirely my fault.

### Name changes, new functions, changed behaviour

* The old `scale` has been renamed to `range`
* `scale` is now used to specify musical scale
* `protate` and friends has been replaced with `rot`
* New function `fix` for manipulating control patterns with matching control values
* New function `mono` for making a pattern monophonic (thanks `bgold`)
* New function `smooth` for turning a discrete/digital numerical pattern into a continuous/analog one, by interpolating between the values (thanks `bgold`)
* Chord names can now be put into numerical patterns, e.g. n "c'maj e'min". The old `chordP` has been removed.
* `discretise` is now known as `segment`
* `e` is now known as `euclid`
* `breakOut` is now known as `arpeggiate`
* Functions generally standardised into being 'slow', e.g. `scan` n will work over n cycles, not squeeze the whole buildup into a single cycle.
* Functions that only worked on one numerical type generalised to work on any where it makes sense, e.g. `rand` can now be used as a pattern of time/rational values as well as double/floating point values (thanks `msp`)
* select functions for choosing between patterns with a pattern of floats
* `wchoose` weights no longer have to add up to `1`
* `weave'` is now known as `weaveWith`
* New `arp` function for arpeggiation
* Easy ways to send Custom OSC to systems other than **SuperDirt**
* The meaning of `stut` and `stutWith` parameters have changed to match each other.

### Interaction

* `solo` now does a 'true' solo. I.e. there is now also `unsolo`.
* You can now run a cycle immediately, once, with `once`
* Experimental transition interpolate for merging between new and old values

### Other new features

* Tidal now takes input from OSC and MIDI - see `Configuration > I/O`. This means you can send numbers and strings into **Tidal** to be used as control values, function parameters, or parsed sequences
* `'Show'` instance for patterns (and control patterns) is now more readable
* If you treat a control pattern as a number, you'll be manipulating the n control, e.g. `(s "bd" # n "1 2") + 3 `will add `3` to both `1` and `2`.
* More parameters are patternable, e.g. `sometimesBy`
* The parser can now produce binary (boolean) patterns where euclidean rhythms produce `true` and `false` values not, true and silence. Useful for use with e.g. `sew` and `struct`
* Configuration is done via a boot script and not environment variables

### Documentation

* Documentation has moved to a wiki (thanks to many, including `kindohm`)
* What we used to call a 'param pattern' is now called a 'control pattern'

### Tempo and scheduling changes

* `setcps` is now used to set a fixed tempo
* Tempo can now be patterned, using `cps` as a control pattern

### Pattern structure

The way patterns are combined has been reworked:

* The old 'structure comes from the left' adage no longer applies - you can now control where structure comes from
* The behaviour of `|+|`, `|*|` has changed.
* `#` works the same as before, but is now an alias for `>|`, rather than `|=|` (which no longer exists).

### Regressions

* `tidal-midi` is not currently working (but midi is still working great via **SuperDirt**)
* `tidalink` is not currently working (should be fixed soon)
* classic **Dirt** is not currently supported (should also be fixed soon)

### Internal and dev changes

* Switched to `system.random` for random number generation (thanks `d0kt0r0`
* **MiniTidal** moved into core tidal repo (thanks `d0kt0r0`)
* Started on a unit test suite (thanks `vivid-synth`, `msp`, `nini-faroux` and co)
* More lawful Applicative and Monad instances for Pattern
* Definition of `<*` and `*>`, that work like `<*> `but using the structure on the left or right
* `<*>` now uses structure on both sides
* `innerJoin` and `outerJoin` for 'flattening' patterns of patterns - works like join but taking structure from the inner or outer pattern respectively.
* Patterns are now flagged as either analog or digital
* **Tidal** is generally a single process, multithreaded thing, rather than multi-process as before
*  The websocket tempo protocol has been replaced with an OSC based one
* The modules have been extensively reorganised, e.g. `Strategies` no longer exists, but `Pattern`, `Core`, `Control` and `UI` do.
* Compiles without warnings
* Better stack support (thanks `tonyday567`)
* Fleshed out datatype structure (thanks `tonyday567`)
* Tidyier travis builds with more haskell versions tested (thanks `tonyday567`)
* New function `inv` for inverting a binary (boolean) pattern
* Calculation is done based on `hZ` rather than calculations/cycle. By default it tidal runs at 20 calculations per second.
